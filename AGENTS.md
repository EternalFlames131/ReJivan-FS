# ReJivan — Project AGENTS.md (workspace developer instructions)

**Owner:** Samrat — teacher trainee, NON-TECHNICAL. Explain in plain steps, avoid jargon.


## SESSION-OPEN PROTOCOL (auto-READ — do this FIRST, always, without being asked)
- The instant a session starts in this folder, BEFORE any other work or reply work: **Read `CONVERSATION.md` and `CONTEXT.md`** (and, if the user mentions it, `README.md`). This is non-optional — it is how the project memory loads automatically.
- Then acknowledge in ONE short line, e.g. "Loaded project memory (current: DAY N, last topic: ...)." — do NOT dump the whole history back at the user.
- If markers/setup are pending from the AUTO-SETUP rule below, handle that too before project work.
- Rule applies on every device, every session, so the user never has to explain anything twice.

## The project
ReJivan = "A Personal Nurse for Every Family" — Hack for Social Cause 2027 (VBYLD 2027, MoYAS + IIT Bombay).
- Idea: remote health monitoring + on-time medicines + automatic emergency help.
- Works **at home AND in hospitals** ("Virtual Ward") — rooms where doctors/nurses can't always be present.
- Two monitoring layers: **wearables/At-Home Monitor** (vitals: HR, SpO2, BP, temp) + **privacy-first camera zones** (falls, out-of-bed, low activity — NO video recorded/stored).
- **Deadline: 15 October 2026** (submission window 1 Sep – 15 Oct 2026). National showcase 10–12 Jan 2027, Delhi.
- **Region: Andaman & Nicobar Islands (UT)** — Samrat's home; HSC state/regional round = A&N (23 Oct – 5 Nov 2026). No district round: Institution → State/Regional → National (IIT-B, 36 finalists) → National Showcase. The prototype demo is anchored in A&N (homes at Junglighat/Little Andaman, Virtual Ward = GB Pant Hospital, Port Blair).

## Where everything lives (this folder = single source of truth, works from any drive)
- `docs/ReJivan_Concept_Document_v1.1.pdf` — concept doc, built from `docs/source/ReJivan_doc_source.html` via `tools/build_pdf.ps1` (needs Edge + Python).
- `references/hsc_guidelines_summary.md` — competition rules/deadlines.
- `prototype/` (to build) · `video/` (to build) · `CONTEXT.md` (full snapshot) · `README.md` (overview) · `CHANGELOG.md` (project log).
- GitHub (**PUBLIC**, branch main): `github.com/EternalFlames131/ReJivan-FS`.

## AUTO-SAVE CONVERSATION MEMORY (so the user never re-explains)
- **RULE (always):** After EVERY turn where decisions, thoughts, or new info were exchanged, append a short dated entry to `CONVERSATION.md` (the project memory). When resuming later, read `CONVERSATION.md` + `CONTEXT.md` first and continue from there — never make the user repeat previously settled details.
- The user has repeatedly asked for this; treat it as non-optional.

## REAL-TIME TASK TRACKING & IMMEDIATE PERSISTENCE (Crash / Shutdown Resilience)
- **RULE (strictly enforced):**
  1. The MOMENT the user asks for anything (new task, feature, analysis, or inquiry), IMMEDIATELY add it to `CONTEXT.md` (as an active open task `- [ ] ...`) and log it in `CONVERSATION.md`.
  2. As soon as that task or step is finished, IMMEDIATELY mark it completed (`- [x] ...`) in `CONTEXT.md` and document the completion in `CONVERSATION.md` (and `CHANGELOG.md`).
  3. This guarantees that if the computer reboots, shuts down, or the session drops at any second, resuming will instantly restore exact awareness of what was in progress and what was finished.


## AUTO-SETUP (automatic - the assistant does it, the user never types a command)
- **RULE (always):** At the start of EVERY session in this folder, check whether a marker file `tools\.setup-done-<this-computer-name>.txt` exists. If it does NOT exist, RUN automatically, without asking and without the user requesting it:
  `pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\setup.ps1`
  Then tell the user one short line: "Auto-setup completed on this device." (or list any yellow reminders).
- Do not block waiting for permission: setup is safe (installs missing tools via winget, locks remote to THIS repo, enables auto-push + auto-deploy). Never skip it silently.
- If the user works from a USB drive, the marker is per-computer, so each new PC triggers setup exactly once.

## First use on a NEW device (one-time, ~2 min)
Run: `pwsh -File tools\setup.ps1`
It checks/installs Python + pypdf + Edge + Git (via winget, asks first), sets LOCAL git identity for this repo only, locks the remote to **this** repo's GitHub, enables auto-push, enables auto-deploy to Vercel (if CLI + login present), checks GitHub login, and tests the PDF pipeline.

## Auto-push + Auto-deploy (enabled for this project only)
- After every `git commit`, a hook **automatically pushes** to `github.com/EternalFlames131/ReJivan-FS` (branch main). If the Vercel CLI is installed and logged in, it **also deploys the production website** (`prototype\` → Vercel). Commits are never blocked; if offline/not-logged-in the hook prints a yellow note and moves on.
- Disable auto-deploy on a machine: create `.git\no-deploy` or set `REJIVAN_NO_DEPLOY=1`.
- **SAFETY (never cross-repo):** the hook only fires when this folder's git `origin` is exactly the ReJivan-FS repo; otherwise it does nothing. The owner has OTHER GitHub repos and global git settings are never touched. Commits themselves are still deliberate (git add + git commit).
- If offline/not logged in, the push is skipped but the commit is safe — run `git push` later.

## Auto-save (AutoSave watcher — commits+pushes+deploys by itself)
- **`tools\autosaver.ps1`** watches the whole project. When a change-set stays stable for 40 s (and > 120 s since the last auto-commit), it runs `git add -A && git commit`. The post-commit hook then auto-pushes + auto-deploys + refreshes `rejivan2.vercel.app` — the user never has to type a command.
- Started automatically at Windows logon via a Startup-folder shortcut ("ReJivan AutoSave"). Pause it anytime by creating the file `.git\no-autosave`; remove it to resume. Its log is `tools\autosaver.log` (gitignored so it can never cause a loop).
- Safety: it only ever runs `git` inside THIS folder's repo; other repos/global settings are untouched. Because the repo is PUBLIC, never add passwords/secrets to files (auto-push sends them).

## Rules
- Owner is non-technical: plain language, no unexplained jargon.
- After finishing/substantial work, append a timestamped line to `CHANGELOG.md` (and the master log). Then commit (auto-push takes care of GitHub).
- Full auto-read behaviour lives in the SESSION-OPEN PROTOCOL above.
- Prototype honesty: always label what is REAL vs SIMULATED in the demo.
